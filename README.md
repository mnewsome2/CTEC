## Getting Started

To explore or utilize the projects in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mnewsome2/CTEC.git
   ```


2. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd CTEC
   ```



3. **Select a project folder**:

   Each project is contained within its respective directory. Navigate to the desired project to view its contents.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* Python 3.x
* Required Python libraries (as specified in each project's `requirements.txt` or within the script)

To install necessary libraries, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note: Not all projects may have a `requirements.txt` file. In such cases, refer to the script for library dependencies.*

## Usage

Each project contains a Python script or a set of scripts demonstrating specific functionalities. To run a script:

```bash
python script_name.py
```


*Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the Python file you wish to execute.*

For projects requiring additional setup or specific instructions, refer to any accompanying documentation or comments within the code.
