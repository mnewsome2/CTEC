# Mikkia Newsome - Cybersecurity Portfolio Website

## 🌐 Overview

This is a personal portfolio website designed for Mikkia Newsome, a seasoned cybersecurity architect. It showcases her experience, projects, and provides a modern, interactive experience for visitors — including a built-in chatbot.

Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, the site includes animated section transitions, a sticky navigation bar, and a JavaScript-powered chatbot assistant named **Mikkia’s Assistant**.

## 📁 Site Structure

The layout is powered by CSS Grid with two main columns:

- **Main Column:** Displays sections for Home, About, Projects, and Contact.
- **Sidebar Column:** Hosts the chatbot widget.

Each section features a unique wave background animation on hover, giving the site a dynamic and modern feel.

## 🚀 Navigation

Navigation links are placed at the top of the page in a **sticky `nav` bar** and include:

- `Home` – Introduction to Mikkia
- `About` – Background, skills, and professional summary
- `Projects` – Key accomplishments and project links
- `Contact` – A contact form for outreach

Smooth scrolling and animated headers enhance the user experience.

## 💬 Chatbot: Mikkia’s Assistant

The site includes a chatbot powered by **JavaScript**. It is toggled using the 💬 chat button in the top-right corner of the screen.

### How It Works

- When a user enters a question or phrase, the chatbot uses keyword matching to determine the most appropriate response.
- All responses are generated using a simple `getBotReply()` function defined in JavaScript.
- Example triggers include:
  - `"hello"` → Friendly greeting
  - `"skills"` → Returns technical proficiencies
  - `"experience"` → Gives a summary of professional background
  - `"projects"` → Lists notable projects

If the input is unrecognized, the bot responds with a helpful fallback message.
